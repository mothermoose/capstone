As many teachers, students, and former students know, group projects can be difficult to manage. StudentUnion is a web application designed to plan, organize, and assess these group projects, providing concrete accountability for all members of a team. In this app, teachers are able to enroll students to thier class, create projects, assign teams and specific tasks to those projects, and receive feedback regarding individual student participation. A student who is logged in can access all projects and teams in which they have been assigned, communicate with other team members, assign themselves tasks to complete, and submit assignments. 

I am currently a Geology and Astronomy teacher at Evanston Township High School. In this role, I have become increasingly interested in incorporating educational technology into my science curriculum. I love the creative ways technology can solve some of the classroom's toughest problems. I joined Actualize to both develop my skills as a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) teacher, and explore software development as a potential career change.
